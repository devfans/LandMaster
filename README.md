## Features:

- Projectile weapon
- Laser weapon
- Main game menu
- Servce as pure client or a listening host
- HUD, Ship health


## Controlls:

- W: Forward
- A: Move Left
- S: Backward
- D: Move Right
- Q: Turn Left
- E: Turn Right
- Space: Shoot Projectile Weapon
- Enter: Shoot Laser Weapon

You are controlling ship as player so looks you are unable to move left, right, or backward directly. But never mind, it's just demo.

## NOTE:

This project is using one effect particle system library(named: InfinityBladeEffect) from unreal asset library store, it's a bit too big to be included into this git repo. The particle is only for weapon attach effect(projectile and laser beam). The build provided was built with the effect included.

This project is using TwinStick as base assets and implemented with online multi-player networking feature.
